### CPSC 120

*Lab 1
   
   Lab 1, I liked Lab 1 because it was the first time I wrote a real C++ program and saw my work actually run. My partner also made it easier because we talked through each step together, which helped me understand the setup and instructions better. I liked this lab because it helped me get comfortable using VS Code and the terminal without feeling stressed.

*Lab 2: 

   Lab 2, was a favorite because I learned how to use variables and take input from the user, which made the program more interactive. My partner helped me understand how storing values works, and working together made the process feel a lot easier and clearer. I liked seeing how the output changed depending on what we typed into the program. I learned how computers store information and how to test my code with different inputs to make sure it works correctly.

*Lab 3

    Lab 3, I enjoyed Lab 3 because it introduced loops and functions, which made my programs more organized and powerful. My partner helped me break the problem into smaller pieces, and talking out the logic together made everything easier to understand. I liked learning how loops can repeat actions without having to write the same code over and over. This lab helped me think more step-by-step and write cleaner, easier-to-read code.
